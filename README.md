>## Data flow
In this project, we have four layers-
* **Controller** - The controller layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer.
* **Repository** - Here database is stored, for which I have used arrayList. In the database layer, CRUD operations are performed.
* **Service** -The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers.
* **DataBase Class** - Here the class user is defined and the whatever a user class will load. e.g -userId, userName, address, phone number etc.
